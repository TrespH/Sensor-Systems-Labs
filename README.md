# Laboratories of Sensor Systems, Polimi course, 2024

Here we list the developed projects, using an STM32 microcontroller with the Nucleo board, provided by the university:

- Lab_3 --> play a song from a snap; play a song without delay
- Lab_4 --> UART with DMA; LCD names
- Lab_5 --> UART DMA receiver; ADC Polling and Interrupt
- Lab_6 --> ADC 3 different samples; ADC LDR brightness sensor
- Lab_7 --> I2C LM75 temperature sensor
- Lab_8 --> I2C accelerometer; I2C accelerometer with DMA and autoincrement
- Lab_9 --> SPI led matrix 7x5, 2 letters alternating
- Lab_10 --> Keyboard 4x4; Encoder readout
- Lab_11 --> Infrared TX/RX via UART
